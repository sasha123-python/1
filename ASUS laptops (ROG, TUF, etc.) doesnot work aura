## ⚠️ Important (RGB / Aura on ASUS laptops)

On ASUS laptops (ROG, TUF, etc.), keyboard RGB / Aura lighting has **limited support on Linux**.

❌ Aura Sync and Armoury Crate are **not available on Linux**  
❌ Built-in laptop keyboards are **often not detected** by OpenRGB  
❌ Full RGB control like on Windows is **not possible**

✅ External USB RGB keyboards usually work fine  
✅ RGB works on Windows because ASUS provides official drivers

This is **not a bug**, but a **Linux limitation and closed ASUS firmware**.
